The unit testing kit for Sukarix, named **Statera**, draws its name from the Latin word meaning 'balance,' symbolising
its role in facilitating stability in software development. Like a balance that ensures equilibrium, Statera provides
the essential tools to detect bugs early, verify that new features integrate smoothly with existing functionality, and
focus testing efforts across different areas of the codebase. While Statera offers the means to achieve stability, the
actual maintenance of software balance depends on how these tools are utilised in the testing process. This approach is
fundamental for creating reliable and high-quality software.
